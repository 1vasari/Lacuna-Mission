Its just the ravings of a madman. Surely it will only lead to trouble if it leads anywhere.\n\nBut if it is true that the map leads to one of the ancients' systems, it is likely we would be able to scavenge their technology and incorporate it into our own. The archaeologist team working with R&D and the  Planetary Command Control engineers assure us that all Orion technology stems from a central hive command and control center. They are optimistic that Orion technology will lead to improved Planetary Command Center plans.","network_19_headline":"Rumors are spreading about one of the ancient races.
