I have been studying their programming, and I am confident I can reprogram the Adecaui Mark I fighters into Mark II fighters. \n\nI am guessing the Mark II fighters utilize propulsion a lot better making them faster as It also improves on the weaponry. I am working on unlocking more Andecaui technology to manufacture even a more powerful fighter. Please provide me with two Andecaui Mark I fighters. I should be able to convert them into Mark II fighters with energy and uraninite.","network_19_completion":"Archeologist discovers basic Adecaui fighter propulsion technology.","name":"Andecaui Mark II Fighter","mission_objective":{"resources":{"energy":60000,"uraninite":15000},"ships":[{"combat":4500,"type":"fighter","stealth":10,"hold_size":0,"speed":1800},{"combat":4500,"type":"fighter","stealth":10,"hold_size":0,"speed":1800}]}}
