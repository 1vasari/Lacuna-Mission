Next up is real love, set on a real freighter.","description":"This is sector-wide film producer,  Mr. Mega Star.  I know audiences everywhere loved the action packed adventure flick, but it seemed too simple.  I need to get to deeper levels, and what better way than to tell a romantic love story against the backdrop of a great tragedy.  Of course I mean the loss of the cruise ship Gigantic, which ran into an asteroid in 9112.  They all thought the ship was the toughest around, so I'll need a big freighter.  You should send along some burgers and bread, too, for my crews.  \n\nThe movie business is a big business, too!   We will, of course, need two such large freighters, and a speedy dory for camera work.  In return, we will help you upgrade your shipbuilding facilities.","network_19_completion":"After successful desert scenes and action packed aerial battles, producer aims for the heart with a deep romance set against a deep tragedy.","name":"The Big Picture pt 3","max_university_level":"25","mission_objective":{"ships":[{"hold_size":0,"speed":2220,"type":"dory","stealth":0},{"hold_size":0,"speed":0,"type":"freighter","stealth":0},{"hold_size":0,"speed":0,"type":"freighter","stealth":0}],"resources":{"cheese":15000,"burger":30000,"bread":30000}}}
