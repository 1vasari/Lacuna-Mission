The only problem is that I'm powerless to stop him. I need someone more capable to send him a warning...that I have friends, and won't take this anymore. I need you to send a snark his way with a message of warning to leave me alone. I don't care if it actually does any damage to him, I just want him to leave me alone. I'll pay you twice whatever it costs to build a snark if you're willing to do this."}
