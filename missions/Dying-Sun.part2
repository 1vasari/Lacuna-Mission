As our old sun on Caldesto continues to die, we piled our \"best and brightest\" on the colony ship to Caldesto II.

Please, send us some cargo ships to help transport our farmers! We'll give you this odd glyph we found in some ruins on our new world.","network_19_headline":"Caldesto II suffering from severe food shortages.
