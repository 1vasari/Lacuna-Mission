Within the data, they have discovered a representation of a transdimensional factory and storage system in orbit around a planet in a system we believe we have identified. This system can only be reached via transit through a series of artificial wormholes left behind by the Orion. We will need to invest heavily in a crash research project to adapt a sweeper specifically to function with the Orion transit system.
