I will spare you the details, but it does require energy to power the nano-bot conversion and uraninite to upgrade the engines. \n\nPlease provide me with an Andecaui Mark I smuggler ship, and another general smuggler ship. I want to convert that ship for my own personal use, as I want to enter the next Vleeslu 5000 race. I am sure I will have the fastest ship for the race!","network_19_completion":"Archeologist application was denied for the Vleeslu 5000 race, on grounds of weapons present on the ship.","name":"Andecaui Mark II Smuggler Ship","mission_objective":{"resources":{"energy":120000,"uraninite":80000},"ships":[{"combat":10,"type":"smuggler_ship","stealth":10000,"hold_size":50000,"speed":3900},{"combat":0,"type":"smuggler_ship","stealth":0,"hold_size":0,"speed":0}]}}
