Our people have suffered for years from mysterious bombings that destroy our cities, but this year has been so much worse. After the usual bombings, a space station burned huge gashes into our planet destroying most of our cities, and when we tried to have this investigated, we received footage of orbital bombings with a warning we would be next.

We can offer you the stockpile of foods and other raw materials we have amassed to survive this siege.","mission_objective":{"ships":[{"hold_size":0,"speed":0,"stealth":0,"type":"drone"},{"hold_size":0,"speed":0,"stealth":0,"type":"drone"},{"hold_size":0,"speed":0,"stealth":0,"type":"drone"},{"hold_size":0,"speed":0,"stealth":0,"type":"fighter"},{"hold_size":0,"speed":0,"stealth":0,"type":"fighter"},{"hold_size":0,"speed":0,"stealth":0,"type":"fighter"},{"hold_size":0,"speed":0,"stealth":0,"type":"fighter"}]},"mission_reward":{"resources":{"milk":5000,"corn":5000,"burger":5000,"fungus":5000,"meal":5000,"root":5000,"potato":5000,"monazite":10000,"wheat":5000,"shake":5000,"lapis":5000,"chip":5000,"water":30000,"pie":5000,"bean":5000,"uraninite":10000,"methane":10000,"syrup":5000,"pancake":5000,"soup":5000,"beetle":5000,"bread":5000,"apple":5000,"sulfur":10000,"algae":5000,"cider":5000,"trona":10000,"cheese":5000,"halite":10000}},"name":"A Desperate Plea For Help","network_19_headline":"Blungun Glumwort begs interstellar community for help."}
