   "description" : "The T.O.A.S.T. expedition has been studying a pre-nova star at close range for several generations now. Their latest research indicates the star is due to go nova within weeks -- and apparently they haven't been doing their starship maintenance, because their evacuation cruiser is no longer spaceworthy. As such, they desperately need a colony ship to escape a fiery death. A short-range one is fine, as they just intend to move out of the nova's destructive range and continue their studies on it. In exchange they can offer a level of university and a glyph they have found.",
