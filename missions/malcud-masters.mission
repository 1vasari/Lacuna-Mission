A terrible wave of genetically engineered weevils, possibly dispatched by the S#b#n, have been destroying the mother colony. An antigen that eradicates the bugs has been developed, but the Malcud Masters require a significant supply of fresh malcud with which to replenish the sacred fields. They turn to the colonies that farm the sacred fungus as a food crop, and offer up all the fluorite and kerogen you'll need to find the glyphs for one or more malcud fields on your own quest for malcud mastery.","max_university_level":"23","mission_type":"trade","network_19_headline":"Sacred malcud fields of Malcus 4 decimated by vicious fungus-eating weevil.
