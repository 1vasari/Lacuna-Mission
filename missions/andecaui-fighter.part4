It seems the weapons system is based on a form of chalcopyrite. If you provide me with a couple Andecaui Mark II fighters, a dory, chalcopyrite, and energy, I can convert the ships into Andecaui Mark III fighters. \n\nThe Mark III is the most advance form of fighter I can unlock at this point. I am certain that once I finish some formulas I may be able to convert this into a heavy fighter. So try and save a couple of these for future use.","network_19_completion":"Archeologist discovers basic Adecaui fighter weapon technology.","name":"Andecaui Mark III Fighter","mission_objective":{"resources":{"energy":60000,"chalcopyrite":25000},"ships":[{"combat":10000,"type":"fighter","stealth":20,"hold_size":0,"speed":5500},{"combat":10000,"type":"fighter","stealth":20,"hold_size":0,"speed":5500}]}}
