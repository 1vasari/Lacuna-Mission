I'll give you a methane glyph for a smuggler ship. The less said about how I procured said glyph the better.","mission_reward":{"glyphs":["methane"]},"network_19_headline":"Ship of infamous smuggler Slick confiscated by law enforcement.","network_19_completion":"Although they captured his ship, smuggler Slick eluded capture by law enforcement once again.","max_university_level":"18"}
