I can procure anything--legal or illegal (but mostly illegal)--in the known universe (just don't ask where it came from). My line of work can be very sensitive, so I need an inconspicuous ship that can easily slip in and out of places. Unfortunately, my previous vehicle was confiscated. I'll give you a methane glyph for a smuggler ship. The less said about how I procured said glyph the better.","mission_objective":{"ships":[{"stealth":10000,"type":"smuggler_ship","hold_size":0,"speed":0}]},"name":"Black Market: Smuggler","mission_reward":{"glyphs":["methane"]},"max_university_level":"18"}
