I can procure anything--legal or illegal (but mostly illegal)--in the known universe (just don't ask where it came from). I've convinced a shipping magnate to trade me three of his old cargo ships in exchange for a shiny new freighter. I had a deal lined up to secure a freighter, but it fell through at the last minute. Now I have three cargo ships headed my way and no freighter to offer in exchange. I wouldn't normally do something like this, but I'm desperate. If you'll donate a scow to me, I'll disguise it as a freighter. By the time the shipping magnate discovers the difference, I'll be long gone. In exchange for your discretion, I'll let you have two of the cargo ships.","mission_objective":{"ships":[{"stealth":0,"type":"scow","hold_size":50000,"speed":0}]},"name":"Black Market: Long Con","mission_reward":{"ships":[{"stealth":3000,"type":"cargo_ship","hold_size":50000,"speed":1500},{"stealth":3000,"type":"cargo_ship","hold_size":50000,"speed":1500}]},"max_university_level":"10"}
