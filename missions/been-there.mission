We seem to have undershot our target, it seems.  We completed a short-range colony ship, but we invested far too much in propulsion.  We now have a regular colony ship, which is much faster, at a fraction of the cost it took us for our \"fast\" Short-range.  If we had simply waited a couple of days, we'd have avoided this sunk cost... But I digress.  We are selling our super-fast short-range colony ship at a loss to recoup some of our energy expenditures.  Have we got a deal?","mission_reward":{"ships":[{"type":"short_range_colony_ship","combat":0,"hold_size":0,"stealth":0,"speed":30}]},"network_19_headline":"The Oyente seeks resources to complete new colony ship.","network_19_completion":"%s assists Oyente with colonization efforts.","max_university_level":"10"}
