I have had some success in discovering ancient Andecaui technology. I just returned from an Andecaui settlement dig. It seems that the Andecaui used a very advanced form of nano-bot manufacturing. They would build a 'core' then program the nano-bots to convert that core into a more useful and specific purposes. \n\nIt turns out that the Andecaui 'probe' is actually a base core they build all their ships from. I think I have discovered how to convert the core into a simple fighter. The fighter is nothing special, but I am certain they can be upgraded as I unlock more of the Andecaui ancient secrets. I will need one Andecaui 'probe'. And with the addition of some energy, I think I can use the probe to convert the dories into  very basic Mark I Andecaui fighters. Lets try it out. \n\n[Be sure to save the fighters, I am certain I can convert them into a more powerful version as I better understand this technology.]","network_19_completion":"Archeologist submits scientific paper on ancient alien construction techniques.","name":"Andecaui Mark I Fighter","mission_objective":{"resources":{"energy":60000},"ships":[{"combat":4,"type":"probe","stealth":0,"hold_size":0,"speed":125}]}}
