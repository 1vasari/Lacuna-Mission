I offer my sincere thanks and appreciation for everything you have already done for us, but I have another request.\n\nOur planet has an over-abundance of waste due to the clean-up efforts as well as re-building. If you could supply us with a Scow as well as taking some of our waste, I would gladly offer you a fighter squadron from one of our border colonies as well as a supply of energy.\n\nAlso, if you can send another shipment of food and water, it would be much appreciated.
