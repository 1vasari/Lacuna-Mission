We here at the lab are proud to announce tremendous success with our newest prototype: a clean, efficient source of cheap energy which utilizes a cascading bioelectric pattern unique to the common potato.  The technology must be researched further before it can be practically used on a mass consumer scale.\n\nWe require a sizable amount of Potatoes to use in our experiments.  In return for your donation, I could maybe pull a few strings and see about getting a new Development Ministry organized on your colony.  I'll even throw in plans for a Potato Patch as well, to help re-stock your supply.","network_19_headline":"Dr Tacinmosh Claims Success With New Potato-based Energy Source!","name":"The Wave of The Future!","network_19_completion":"%s Wins Praise For Helping Dr Tacinmosh With Research.","max_university_level":"3"}
