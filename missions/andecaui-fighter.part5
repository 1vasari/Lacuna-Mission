I am almost able to apply Andecaui technology to produce an Andecaui sweeper using their Mark III fighters, but I need some questions answered. It would be great if I had another Andecaui site to research. \n\nYou can help by sending excavators to the following planets which match the Andecaui profile. I am sure one of these planets will hold the answer to my immediate research questions. Once that happens I will convert some Andecaui Mark III fighters into an Andecaui Mark I sweeper. \n\nThe Andecaui sweeper will be more effective than most civilizations in the expanse can construct themselves. Not a bad result from a lowly probe. Nano-technology is so wonderful! However the process does require a lot of energy due to the nature of the conversion.","network_19_completion":"Archeologist team starts to research new Andecaui site.","name":"Andecaui Mark I Sweeper","mission_objective":{"fleet_movement":[{"target":{"inhabited":0,"type":"habitable","size":[1,121],"isolationist":0,"in_zone":1},"ship_type":"excavator"},{"target":{"inhabited":0,"type":"habitable","size":[1,121],"isolationist":0,"in_zone":1},"ship_type":"excavator"}],"resources":{"energy":300000},"ships":[{"combat":15000,"type":"fighter","stealth":30,"hold_size":0,"speed":8000},{"combat":15000,"type":"fighter","stealth":30,"hold_size":0,"speed":8000}]}}
