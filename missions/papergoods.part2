Unfortunately our luck didn't hold as our recently demoted branch manger, Mikale Scoot, found a way to wreck our entire paper delivery fleet.  We'll make you a deal.  If you can provide us with a replacement fleet fast enough to get these back orders out, we'll send Mikale your way.  As a manager, I think he'll really help you out in your Oversight Ministry.  Just keep an eye on that one - and don't let him drive!"}
