Zyler Mining has contracted for 100,000 Trona and 100,000 Zircon to build and supply Barren Wuffetts new Waste Energy Plants. This strike has ground production to a halt and Zyler mining is 80,000 short of Zircon and 85,000 short in Trona. To complete this contract they are willing to provide 2 cargo ships to carry the ore and let you keep them when finished. Time is of the essence, so these cargo ships are also faster than normal."}
