It has happened again, we have broken our most holy and almighty Tronul moments after a brave space captain brought us a new one. We cannot carry on this way, a solution must be found. We require certain components to start producing more Tronuls, so we always have a backup, just in case. Some Water and Energy which our machines can whip into a helix sort of shape, some Halite we can extrude into long spindles, and some of those shiny red things you call \"Apples\" should do the trick. Please help! In exchange we can offer you our last 2 ultra-fast model probes.","network_19_headline":"Wigut Empire High Proctor calls for mass production as important holy artifact is broken, again.","network_19_completion":"In a special ceremony, the Wigut High Proctor blesses %s with the first of thousands of new Tronuls.","max_university_level":"7","mission_objective":{"resources":{"halite":1000,"energy":2000,"apple":1000,"water":1000}}}
