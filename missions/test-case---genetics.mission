The feedstock for this synthesis consists of Anthracite, Kerogen, Methane, catalyzed by a Beryl/Gold alloy with a Halite concentration step.\n\nLong story short: get those materials (we don't care how), ship them to our research facility, and the research community is willing to set up your next university for you.","mission_reward":{"plans":[{"classname":"Lacuna::DB::Result::Building::University","level":8,"extra_build_level":0}]}}
