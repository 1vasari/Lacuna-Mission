Provost says Columbite to be decoded \"soon\".","name":"Bowling for Columbite","description":"Researchers working for that venerated hall of learning, Ubb City University, have discovered an incredibly rare glyph composed of a material they're currently referring to as 'Columbite.' The material appears to be a synthetic ore, most likely created from two more common, naturally occurring ores, using some heretofore unknown ancient technology. The University aims to collect enough donations to allow it to found a centre dedicated to studying exomaterials. In exchange, they offer a complete spectrum sample kit of known natural ores ready for analysis at any competent archeology lab.","max_university_level":"25","mission_type":"trade","network_19_headline":"Ubb City University discovers fantastic new synthetic 'Columbite' ore Glyph.
