We,the Crexeplian empire seek knowledge of glyphs. However our government foolishly shut down our funding. They say we are in debt, and are hoping to save on expenses... or so we're told. Anyway, we need 10 Excavators to continue our search for glyphs. We will also need a large sum of energy or we wont be able to power them.
